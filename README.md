# Data-Exploration-and-Machine-Learning-on-Aviation-Accidents

Raw statistical data from the Aviation dataset has been:  

● Prepared and Cleaned  
● Exploratored and Analysed (with Cleaned Data)  
● Focused Data Preparation through Downsampling & Ordinal Scale Conversion  
● Applied Machine Learning methods  

All of which are to help in the prediction of fatal airplane accidents; and how to detect early and predict potential fatal aircraft accidents.  
  
The Machine Learning methods used for this prediction are: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
